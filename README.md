This repository contains an implementation of the `hmac-bcrypt` password hashing function for the [Laravel Framework](https://github.com/laravel/laravel). They are based on the reference implementation created by [@epixoip]( https://github.com/epixoip ) (specifically [the PHP one](https://github.com/epixoip/hmac-bcrypt/blob/main/php/src/)).

If you are asking yourself why, you can read the [technical justification](https://github.com/epixoip/hmac-bcrypt#justification) on the original implementation.
